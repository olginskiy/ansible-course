# Configuration management

## Before configuration management

I thought it might make sense to give you a brief overview of which problem Ansible is trying to solve. Imagine for a minute that you want to install VM/Application/Web server/Whatever. Let's imagine you have a management node and an env. Mgmt node is  your laptop, desktop, or even a server you have access to, we will call it the management node. The env are your client servers, our CDE or a cloud provider like AWS/Azure/GCP.  Let's imagine, we wanted to turn this freshly installed VM into an Application installation. How would we do that? Well, we could do this manually by reading tons of documentation, sshing into the machine, and running the commands to install all needed software, editing the configuration files by hand, and finally configuring Application via Web UI. After all that the machine is configured and working. This is pretty common practice, but there is a lot of manual work.

Unfortunately, each machine is like a little snowflake depending on who installed it. It is also a real pain when a machine dies and we are not really sure how it was created, or how we can recreate it quickly./ I hope you have got the main idea, that at this stage we should constantly install packages, check if the service works, install more packages, and tweak things manually until the service is ok. There is a solution for that. It is CM

## Configuration management. What is it?

What is configuration management? CM is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a system's configuration with its requirements. Let's think about this together. What does it mean? Originally, it means that you create some kind of guidelines & workflows. It describes how to manage changes; your servers; systems and so on. Also it should reduce count unique snowflakes and your server's configuration should be the same. Sometimes, it helps to reduce configuration drift. Configuration drift is the difference between desired configuration & real configuration.

Generally it boils down to:

* Managing file content.
* Configuration templating.
* System and service state.
* Package management.
* Lifecycle management.

## What is Ansible?

![Configuration management](assets/01_15.png?raw=true "configuration management")

How is CM linked with Ansible? Let's find out. There has to be a better way right? Well, this is where configuration management tools come in. At a basic level, they are designed to automate much of this manual work. It helps you to save your time, reduce stress, and generally improve processes.

* **Configuration management** - Ansible is a modern IT configuration management tool which makes your life easier by managing your servers for you.
* **Open source software** - Ansible is a open source software for configuration management & applications deployment. It allows you to automate existing processes. Also you should not pay for using Ansible.
* **IT automation tool** - Ansible is a simple agentless idempotent IT automation tool that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

## Why Ansible?

## Ansible

![Configuration management](assets/01_21.png?raw=true "configuration management")

* **Efficient** : Agentless. Ansible is completely agentless. You don't need any additional software or ports on your servers. No extra software on your servers. This means more resources for your applications. There is no additional firewall ports. This means you don't need additional conformation from IT or network security guys.
* **Simple** : Declarative language. Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It's very easy to understand and use for daily routines. You don't need to be a developer to write code for your server configuration.
* **Secure** : SSH / WinRM transport. Ansible uses the secure shell transport layer protocol (SSH) for communications with target hosts. Ansible is also great for both ops and dev because you do not have to provide root account. Ansible is just using ssh to log into the remote machines, so there is a clear separation of duties if need be. Also, it's possible to integrate with secret management solutions like a hashicorp vault.
* **Powerful & Flexible** : Modules. Ansible has powerful features that can help you to model the most complex IT workflows. In this sens, Ansible helps you to manage the infrastructure, networks, operating systems and services that you are already using. Also, Ansible provides you with hundreds of modules to manage them.  Moreover, it's possible to extend Ansible by modules written in a programming language you already know.
* **Mature** : Supported by Red Hat. Ansible is a production ready software. It's supported & developed by Red Hat.

## Ansible use cases

![Configuration management](assets/01_33.png?raw=true "configuration management")

### Configure VMs

Our workflow looks like

1. You Update git & review changes.  It's possible to run some [tests](https://www.goncharov.xyz/it/ansible-testing-en.html) for it.
2. Jenkins applies VM's configurtaion.

There are two interesting results:

1. we can track VM's configuration changes.
2. we can recreate VM with exactly the same configuration.

However, it's possible to upgrade the existing workflow. Do you know how VMs were created?

### Create VMs

it's possible to create new VMs with Ansible. However, I'd like to notice that in our days the most popular solution for creating VMs is terraform. Terraform enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure. I.e. as PoC we can create VMs inside VMM  from Ansible but it's dirty solution:

![Configuration management](assets/01_vmm.png?raw=true "configuration management")

* Ansible connects to Windows host
* Ansible executes powershell Create new linux VM at vsphere via Ansible

Hopefully, there are some over devops friendly ways. I.e. you can deploy VM from OVF template from content library via [vmware_content_deploy_ovf_template](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/blob/main/plugins/modules/vmware_content_deploy_ovf_template.py) module.

### Create VM template

![Configuration management](assets/01_packer.png?raw=true "configuration management")

Let's think together. How was VM template created? We create a Linux virtual machine template via packer. Packer is a tool from hashicorp stack for building VM images in different cloud providers or virtualization systems. In short:

1. Packer creates a new VM, e.g. from ISO
2. Packer applies the VM configuration, i.e. technical users, needed software etc. The configuration might be described with Ansible playbooks.
3. Packer exports the VM template
4. Also we store the VM template configuration in git. It means that we can manage  changes. We know how it was built & we can recreate VM with exact the same result.

### Install App into K8S & Build container

![Configuration management](assets/01_35.png?raw=true "configuration management")

It's possible build container via ansible & deploy them to Openshift or k8s. You can read about it in the article [Let's deploy to Openshift](https://www.goncharov.xyz/it/deploy2openshift-en.html)

## About Ansible

### Glossary

* **Playbooks** are Ansible language.
* A **play** is a mapping between hosts & the tasks.
* **Tasks** combine an action with a name.
* An **action** specifies the modules to run.
* **Modules** are the units of work.
* **Roles** are bundle of related tasks.

### How does it work?

![Configuration management](assets/01_47.png?raw=true "configuration management")

1. We start with a management node. we should prepare a management node somehow. Usually, it's just a Linux server with installed Ansible. I suppose that every OS distribution already has Ansible in a package management system. So you should do something like yum install Ansible.
2. After that, you should describe a list of your hosts in an inventory. The host inventory file is basically just a listing of hosts that you want to manage with Ansible. Usually, It's a simple plain text file in YAML or INI format. Moreover, you can use dynamic inventory and export your hosts from cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure or your private cloud.
3. After that, you should describe the desired configuration. We call it playbooks. Playbooks are configuration files that describe tasks that should be performed. Playbook is a list of tasks in a declarative YML format, i.e. install PostgreSQL, wildfly, update the application server configuration files, deploy applications jar files and so on. I should mention that you do not need to know that much about this right now. we will talk about them later. It is just important to know these configuration files exist.
4. Ansible copies the executable code to the target hosts & ansible executes code on Target Hosts.
